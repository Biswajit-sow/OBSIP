            What is Sanatan dharma and what is Bhagvat Gita?
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            "Sanatan Dharma," commonly known as Hinduism, is an ancient and diverse tradition rooted in the concept of
            eternal order. This multifaceted philosophy encompasses a wide array of beliefs, rituals, and philosophies 
            designed to guide individuals toward righteous living. Central to Sanatan Dharma are principles such as dharma 
            (moral duty) and karma (the law of cause and effect), which underpin the ethical framework of the tradition.
            The ultimate aspiration is moksha, liberation from the cycle of rebirth and unity with the divine.In the Hindu pantheon,
            Lord Krishna holds a significant place, revered as an incarnation of the divine. The Bhagavad Gita, a revered scripture
            within Sanatan Dharma, captures a profound conversation between Lord Krishna and Prince Arjuna, offering timeless insights
            into duty, righteousness, and spiritual paths. Embracing a rich tapestry of deities and drawing wisdom from the Vedas, Sanatan
            Dharma embodies a timeless quest for truth, virtue, and the realization of one's divine nature.
